# Scanport Detector

A simple tool to detect port scans on servers. 

It's able to detect simple port scans and distribute the information to other servers if a Redis server is available.

For educational purposes only and to learn packet capture using GoLang.

WIP!

To Do:
- Detect more advanced features of Nmap's port scanning.
- Run commands on detect port scanning: iptables, firewall,etc
- Ingest data into a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems.
- Better documentation :p
